## 🚀 Overview

**DM-SAM** is a novel framework that integrates the **Diffusion Model (DM)** and the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** for medical image synthesis.  
The key idea is to leverage the **uncertainty** of diffusion model outputs as **prompts** to guide SAM-based image synthesis refinement.

## 📊 Datasets

Experiments in this paper were conducted on three publicly available datasets:

- **[BraSyn 2023](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53708249/wiki/627507)** — 1,470 MRI scans of brain tumor patients for multi-contrast MRI synthesis.  
- **[SynthRAD 2023](https://synthrad2023.grand-challenge.org)** — 120 paired T1CE–CT brain scans for MRI-to-CT synthesis.  
- **[SynthRAD 2025](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org)** — 258 paired CBCT–CT scans for thoracic cancer radiotherapy planning.
